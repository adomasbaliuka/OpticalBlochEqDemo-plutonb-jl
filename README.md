# OpticalBlochEqDemo-plutonb-jl
Demo of [optical bloch equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Bloch_equations) (using and based on QuantumOptics.jl)

Based on https://docs.qojulia.org/examples/atom-dephasing/

With slight changes in conventions, simplifications and **sliders to change parameters** in a Pluto notebook. Also no explanations here!
